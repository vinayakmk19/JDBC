Static in java
  It is called as Class level one time execution block.
  In the application execution,JVM will load the class file only once and everytime when
  the class file gets loaded it is the static block of the class which will be executed..
  Inside the static block,we write a code for Intitalizing the static variables.
  Syntax:
     static{
	---------logic-------
     }
  If we want,only one connection with respect to the database,irresepctive of the no of object
  we create then such logic can be placed inside the static block.

Constructor in Java(Dependancy Injection)
  It is called as Object level exeuction block.
  Jvm while creating the object,it would call the constructor through which it creates the 
  object.
  Inside the Constructor,we write a code for Initializing the instance variables(fields)
  of the class.
  Syntax:
      <AccessModifier> className(<params>){
		----logic----
      }
   If we want multiple connection with respective database,we should write that logic within
   the constructor of the class.
   **Constructor of the class wont be called if Clone the object or if we Desrialize the object.  

Can we execute a program without writing main()?
   Ans.Yes it possible,but depends on java version the programmer uses.
       jdk6:Yes possible with respect to static block
       jdk7:Not possible.
       jdk8:Yes possible with respect to static block but the class should extend one inbuilt abstract class called
                        javafx.application.Application.
       jdk9,10,11....:Not possible with static block,because the javafx package has been removed from JDK9 onwards..

      Refer to JDK6.java,JDK7.java,JDK8.java,JDK14.java

Note:We can have multiple jvm's in single machine.

How will programmer come to know which version of jdk is used to generate the .class file?
Ans.To check the .class file version we have one java command called
     javap -verbose classFileName.

      MajorVersion                     JDK version
        50                                 jdk6
        51                                 jdk7
        52                                 jdk8
        -                                  ----

Can we run our program without writing a userdefine class?
Ans.Yes it is possible
     JDK5:Using enum's
     JDK7:Using interfaces
    
     Refer to Demo.java(enum) , Sample.java(interface)


Note:In single java file can we write multiple classes(valid)
     If we write multiple classes inside java file,will access modifer plays a vital role in saving the file?
     Ans.Yes,access modifier plays a vital role,that is only one class should be made as public and the file should be saved with
         same className.



API
   API stands for Application Programming Interface.
   Here the word Interface should not be taken as Java Interface.
   Here interface means english word that is standard blocks which is used for communication.

Language
 C=======>#include<stdio.h>
   In this language API means collections of few predefined functions like printf(),scanf(),getch() available inside
   header files.
 Java====>import java.util.*;
    In this language API means collection of classes,interface,enum,annoation available inside the packages.
    In java language API will come as JAR.
    Entire java would be given to java programmers as JARs in the form of JDk software.
    All the commonly used classes,interfaces are available to java programmer in jdk software in the form of a jar
    by the name rt.jar.(runtime.jar)
    It is avaialbe in the following path:C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jre1.8.0_271\lib\rt.jar
