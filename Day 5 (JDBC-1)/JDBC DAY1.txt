 Technology
    It is a specification which gives bunch of rules(interface,abstractclass)
and guideliness(concrete class) in the form of an api to develop an implementation
software through one or the other programming language.
     eg: JDBC Technology
         SUN/Oracle specificiation is only JDBC API(java.sql.* and javax.sql.*)
            
         SERVLET Technology
            SUN/Oracle specificiation is only SERVLET API(javax.servlet.*)


Classification of Technologies
  1.Open technology
  2.Propritieatary Technology

OpenTechnology
    In this technology,rules and guideliness are open to all s/w vendors to implement
    the required s/w.
      eg:JDBC,Servlets,JSP,JavaMail,JAAS,......

Propritieatary Technology
     In this technology, rules and guideliness are not open to all s/w vendors to implement
     the required s/w.
       eg:ASP.net,WEBSERVER,......

JDBC 
  JDBC is a open technology given by sun/Oracle in the form of api(rt.jar) to build the neccessary driver 
  s/w to interact with the database.

Terminlogies associated with JDBC
1.Persistence
2.Persistence Store
3.Persistence Data
4.Peristence Operation
5.Persistence Logic
6.Persistence technology/Framework


Persistence:It is the process of storing and managing the data for a long time is called Persistence.
            To achieve Persistencey we use files,DBS/w,etc...
 
Why we need persistence?
   In java language,we store the data in the form of objects,arrays,variables... but if we store the data
   inside this variables,objects,arrays it would be on the heap memory(jvm) only till jvm executes the program
   once jvm finishes its execution memory for those variables,objects,arrays would be vanished.To store
   the data permanently we need persistency.


PersistenceStore:The place/software where the data is stored and managed for a long time is called
                  Persistence store
                  eg:files,DBS/w(database--->table---->record)


PersistenceData:The data of PersistenceSore is called Persistence data.
                  eg:File data,DBS/w data(records)

PersistenceOperation:Insert,Select,Update,Delete operations are performed on Persistence Data we called its
                       as persistence operations.

                      Create(Insert)
                      Read(Select)
                      Update(Update)
                      Delete(Delete)
                     In short developers alwasy perform CRUD operations on PersistenceData.

PersistenceLogic:The logic which is written to perform Peristence operation is called Persistence Logic
                   eg:jdbccode,hiberantecode,springjdbccode,springhibernatecode......

PersistencTechnology:The technology which is used to develop a persistence logic is called Persistence 
                      technology.
                   eg:JDBC(technology),Hibernate(tool),SpringJDBC(framework),SpringORM(framework)
                      SpringDatajpa(Framework--->springboot)


Note::We use PersitenceTechnology to write persistence logic to perform persistence operation on peristence
      data avialable in peristence store.



How to achieve persistency in javalangauge
Ans. Language:Through java.io packages we can achieve persistency.........
     Technology:Through jdbc api(rt.jar) as java.sql.* and javax.sql.* packages we can achieve persistency.

              java.sql(corepackage)                         
  classes(guidelines)    interfaces(rules)
  DriverManager           Driver
  Types                   Connection
  Date                    Statement
  TimeStamp               PreparedStatement
   ---                    CallableStatement
   ---                     -----

               javax.sql(extendedpackages)
     classes(guidelines)            interfaces(rules)
       StatementEvent                RowSet                      
       ConnectionEvent               DataSource
       RowSetEvent                   PooledConnection
        ----                          -----


 Note:Programmer/developer is not responsible for giving implementation for the interfaces avaialble inside
      java.sql.* or javax.sql.* packages.Third party vendors will give the implementation s/w to the 
      developers in the form of jars which we call it as Drivers/w.

What is jdbc driver s/w?
    It acts as a bridge b/w java application and database s/w.
    It refers to collection of classe,interface given by third party vendor by implmenting the specification
    given by SUN/Oracle.
    These driver s/w would be given to the devleopers in the form of .jar so that he can use in java application  to perform persitence operation.

      SUN/Oracle
          100classes
          100interfaces
        only specification(rt.jar)

vendor1
    Oracle
         we give implementaion to specification given by SUN/oracle
         oracle will give the implement s/w in the form of ojdc.jar


vendor2
    Mysql
          we give implementaion to specification given by SUN/oracle
          mysql will give the implemented s/w in the form of mysql.jar

vendor3
    Postgress SQL
          we give implementaion to specification given by SUN/oracle
          PostgressSql will give the implemented s/w in the form of postgressSql.jar

Note:Since devlopers write the code using jdbcapi,not with respect to driver s/w easily we can achieve
     loose coupling.
